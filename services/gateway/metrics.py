"""Prometheus metrics (ARCHITECTURE.md §7, ROADMAP item 25).

Exactly the §7-prescribed set, no more. Definitions only — increments live at the
interceptor's three terminal emission points, the Drift Detector's classification
writes, and the audit verifier's failure branch. Served via start_http_server on a
separate internal-only port (settings.metrics_port), never on the published app
port: labels carry identity ids and tool names, and the §7 posture is an
unauthenticated endpoint that is simply unreachable from outside the compose
network.
