"""Policy activation record-keeping (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.8, item 19).

Every successful activation (startup, SIGHUP reload, admin rollback) leaves two
records: an append-only revision snapshot at policies/revisions/v{n}.yaml holding
the exact policy file bytes, and a policy_versions row (version, content_hash,
activated_at, activated_by). Forward activations are monotonic: the YAML `version`
must be strictly greater than the highest ever recorded; re-activating the same
(version, content_hash) pair is an idempotent no-op; the same version with different
content is rejected fail-closed (§5). Rollback is exempt — it re-activates an
already-recorded version, refreshing that row's activated_at/activated_by.
