# ADR-001 — FastAPI over Flask/Django

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use FastAPI (async-native) as the gateway's web/proxy framework.

**Reasoning:** The gateway is fundamentally I/O-bound — most of its time is spent waiting on upstream MCP servers (over stdio subprocess or SSE), Redis, and Postgres. Flask would need an async extension bolted on to handle this well; Django brings ORM/admin machinery this project doesn't use and adds framework weight without a corresponding benefit for a proxy service with no server-rendered pages or admin panel in the traditional Django sense.

**Alternatives considered:** Flask (+async extensions), Django, a bare ASGI app with no framework.
